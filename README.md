# This folder contains tests for OJP 1.0 and OJP 2.0 for Switzerland
Contact: opendata@sbb.ch

This repo contains different tests for OJP instances in Europe. The main focus is the Swiss servers  (see https://opentransportdata.swiss)

# OJP 2.0 SOAPUI
Some tests for SOAPUI: https://github.com/openTdataCH/ojp-soapui-tests/tree/main/Swiss-OJP-2.0
You need to add the necessary information directly to the global properties of your SOAPUI.

# LinkingAlps SOAPUI
## How to sort
Add for each kind of system a folder and structure which match the OJP Router Structure with its subsystems. E.g. for the LinkingAlps project and its use cases for passive systems make sub folders like: "LinkingAlps/SBB passive server" or "LinkingApls/STA active server".

## Adding test cases
Make meaningful names for the file containing the testcase

## Remarks
The term active system is a server which integrates several passive systems, which is referenced in the OJP specification as a distributed OJP router.

We have test cases for OJP 2.0.
In https://github.com/openTdataCH/ojp-soapui-tests/tree/main/ojp2-req-res-examples there is a pyhton program, that:

# Automated Request/Response tests
In the folder ojp2-req-res-examples we do some some generations of from given requests into responses with validation (and unfortunately validation errors).
